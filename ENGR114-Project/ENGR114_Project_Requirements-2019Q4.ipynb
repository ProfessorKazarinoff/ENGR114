    "The Engineers solve the world's problems in teams. Often teams of Engineers include different types of Engineers working together. In this team project, you will be part of a group that solves an engineering problem with programming. Your project needs to including some sort of hardare (although there are a couple of exceptions) and some component of software. The hardware could be a sensor like a temperature, light, pressure, pH, turbidity, etc. Or the hardware could be an \"output\" like a motor, a servo, a light, a valve, a screen, etc.\n",
