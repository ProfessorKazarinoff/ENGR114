    "Before starting the lab, familiarize yourself with what an Arduino is and what an Arduino can be used for. You will .nd numerous projects if you google “Arduino project”. Try to download the Arduino IDE using the following link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Be sure to select: Windows ZIP .le for non admin install as new software can not be installed on lab computers without administrator privileges. Investigate the Arudino IDE (launched by double clicking Arduino.exe). See what is available in the File .Examples menu. Before lab, also familiarize yourself with the concept of serial communication. In this lab, Python will communicate with an Arduino over a serial connection. Serial communication is one of the older computer hardware communication specifications and a precursor to USB (universal serial bus) communication used by keyboards, mice thumb drives etc. Part of the lab will follow a tutorial from the Sparkfun Inventor’s Kit (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/12060) click on the Documents link on the product page to review the guide.
