    " * Start working with your .py-file as a regular script (not a function) with hard coded input values.  This way you can easily run and re-run it for testing.\n",

    " * Once both of these capabilities are working, complete the input validation for all of the input variables.\n",
    " * Test your code often!\n",
    " * Wait until you have verified your function works, along with its input validation, before changing it into a function.\n",
    " * Now call your function ```taylor()``` from within the **taylor_series.py** file .  It is easier to change values and re-run this way, versus importing the function and calling ```>>>taylor('sin',4,10)``` from the Python REPL.\n",
    " * Verify your results. Compare the results of you Taylor Series function to Python's **math** module functions ```math.exp()``` and ```math.sin()```."
