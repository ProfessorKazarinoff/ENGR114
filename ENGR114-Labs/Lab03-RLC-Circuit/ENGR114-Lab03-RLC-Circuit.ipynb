    "Before starting this assignment, read through this entire document, then create a pseudocode outline of what your program will do.   Simply put, pseudocode is committing the tasks your code will carry out to paper, in plain English.  When writing pseudocode, you should not worry about how to write specific commands.  Instead, set up an outline of specific things that need to be accomplished.  This can take the form of a bulleted list, paragraphs of writing, or a flowchart.  This in meant for you to read, not Python.  The point of this is to think about what should happen without worrying about how.  Be specific.  You can start with a rough sketch, but you should refine it into smaller, explicit steps before beginning to code.  Before asking for help with this lab, you should show your instructor your pseudocode."

You will not have to worry about the circuit analysis, as that part of will be done for you.  The voltage source has a frequency of 60 hertz, it has an amplitude of 120 volts RMS, the resistor has 100 ohms of resistance.  You need not care about these parameters because they will be built into the equations given to you later."
