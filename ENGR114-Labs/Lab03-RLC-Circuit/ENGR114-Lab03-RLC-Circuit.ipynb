    "Before starting this assignment, read through this entire document, then create a pseudocode outline of what your program will do.   Simply put, pseudocode is committing the tasks your code will carry out to paper, in plain English.  When writing pseudocode, don't worry about how to write specific commands.  Instead, set up an outline of specific things that need to be accomplished.  This can take the form of a bulleted list, paragraphs of writing, or a flowchart. Pseudocode is meant for you to read, not Python.  The point of writing pseudocode is to think about what should happen without worrying about how.  Be specific.  Start with a rough sketch, then refine it into smaller, explicit steps before beginning to code.  Before asking for help with this lab, you should show your instructor your pseudocode."

    "The context of this lab involves a series circuit with an AC voltage source, one resistor, one capacitor, and one inductor.  You do not have to worry about the circuit analysis, as that part will be done for you.  The voltage source has a frequency of 60 hertz, and an amplitude of 120 volts RMS. The resistor has 100 ohms of resistance.  Don't be concerned with these these parameters because the source amplitude and voltage as well as the resistor resistance is built into the equations shown later in the la."
