Browse to the public weather station in Natick, MA at Mathwork’s Headquarters (the company that makes MATLAB) at https://thingspeak.com/channels/12397. This is the IoT device we will interact with using a web API. "

    "For this group lab assignment, your group will use Python to interact with a web API to dynamically collect weather information from a Natick, MA weather station and display it to the user. The program will ask the user if they want to plot temperature, humidity, rainfall or pressure. Then the program will ask the user for the number of data points they want to plot. Finally, the program will produce a plot of the selected weather data from the Natick, MA weather station. "

    " * Clean up the data received from the ThingSpeak web API and produce a simple 1D array or series which contains the data points. \n",
    " * Build a plot that displays the data the user asked for. The plot should contain the data point number on the x-axis and the weather data on the y-axis. Include axis labels (with units) and a descriptive title. "
