    "[MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) is a port, or version of Python designed to run on small, inexpensive, low-power microcontrollers. Traditionally, Python is run on a desktop or laptop computer (also on cloud servers). Compared to a desktop or laptop, microcontrollers are much smaller, cheaper and less powerful.  A \"regular\" version of Python can't run on small, cheap microcontrollers because Python is too resource intensive. Regular Python takes up too much hard disk space, runs on too much RAM and requires a more powerful processor than microcontrollers have. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get MicroPython to run at all on these small microcontroller boards, MicroPython only contains a subset of all the standard library modules included with \"regular\" Python. Some of the libraries that are included with MicroPython don't have the full set of functions and classes that come with the full version of Python. This limited functionality allows MicroPython to be compact (around 600 kB for the ESP8266 port) and only use a small amount of RAM (down to 16k according to the [Micropython main page](https://micropython.org/).)"
