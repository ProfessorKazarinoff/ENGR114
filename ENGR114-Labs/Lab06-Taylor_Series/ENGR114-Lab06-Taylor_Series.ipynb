A Taylor Series is an infinite series of mathematical terms that when summed together approximate a mathematical function. Taylor Series can be used to approximate $e^x$, $sine$, and $cosine$. An example of a Taylor series is below:\n",

    " * Now call your function from a separate m-file.  It is easier to change values and re-run this way,v versus calling it from the command line each time.\n",
    " * Verify your results.  Is your algorithm actually converging on a real solution?  You can add in a variable that sums each term's results. Compare the results of adding the Taylor Series terms to Python's **math** module functions ```math.exp()``` and ```math.sin()```."
