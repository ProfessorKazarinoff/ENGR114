    " * It is really hard to break a Circuit Playground Express. As long as you don't throw the device across the room, or hit it with a hammer, the very worst thing that can happen is that you have to unplug the Circuit Playground Express and restart your computer. Play around with the code and try new things. You won't break anything.\n",

    " * Remember **indentation is important in Python!** If the indentation of Python code is not entered correctly, the code will not run as expected.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Python is case sensitive.  Capital ```A``` and lowercase ```a``` are different in Python. Pay attention to the words ```True``` and ```true```. Python treats these two keywords differently.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Use colons (```:```) where noted. It is easy to forget colons at the end of certain code lines.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Generally, spaces within lines of Python code don't make a difference. But be careful with parenthesis ```( )``` and square brackets ```[ ]```.\n",

    " * You can comment out blocks of code by surrounding the code with triple quotes ```\"\"\"       \"\"\"````.\n",
