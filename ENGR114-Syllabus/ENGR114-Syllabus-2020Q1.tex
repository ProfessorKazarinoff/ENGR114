  USB thumb drive. 1GB size or larger will work fine. Bring to every
  class.
\item
  Scientific Calculator
\item
  Access to the course programming environment, available online at
  \url{https://engr114.org}. An @pcc.edu email address and password is
  needed to login. Log into your @pcc.edu email account and then open
  the course programming environment. You can also use Google CoLab
  \url{https://colab.research.google.com} with your @pcc.edu account.
\item
  A laptop or home computer is not required for the course. If you use

\subsection{Course Components}\label{course-components}}

    \hypertarget{homework}{%
\subsubsection{Homework}\label{homework}}

Homework is intended as a means of practicing the concepts presented in
class. Timely submission of homework via Desire2Learn (D2L) is required.
\textbf{No late homework is accepted in this course.} The D2L upload
folder will close to submissions after the assignment deadline. With
this in mind, your \textbf{lowest homework score of quarter will be
dropped}. All homework assignments are weighted equally. Check D2L for
assignments, homework format, and submission deadlines. Homework will be
graded on format, completion, and running without any errors.

    \hypertarget{exams}{%
\subsubsection{Exams}\label{exams}}

If a student is unable to take the exam when it is scheduled, it is the
student's responsibility to notify the instructor \textbf{at least 1
week prior to the date of an exam}. Make-up exams, if allowed, will be
scheduled by the instructor after consulting with the student
\textbf{prior} to the original date of the exam. I look forward to
working with any students who have testing accommodations. It is the
student's responsibility to set up a meeting \textbf{at least 1 week
prior to the exam date} to review exam protocol as the testing center
does not have laptops with the course programming environment installed.
There will be two Exams in the course. One Midterm Exam and one Exam the
last week of classes.

\hypertarget{during-exams}{%
\paragraph{During Exams:}\label{during-exams}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exams will be taken during lecture or lab time in the classroom.
\item
  Exams will have two parts, a written portion, and a computer portion

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    During the written portion, you cannot use a computer and computer
    monitors must be off.
  \item
    During the computer portion, you must use the computers in the
    classroom. No student laptops allowed on exams.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Generally, a calculator and one page of notes are allowed on the
  exams, both during the written and computer portions.
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{labs}{%
\subsubsection{Labs}\label{labs}}

Typically, lecture is held early in the week and lab held later in the
week. This is subject to change. Lab assignments are typically due at
the end of the lab period, uploaded to D2L. \textbf{No late labs will be
accepted}. \textbf{You must be present in lab to receive credit for the
lab assignment}. Your \textbf{lowest lab score of the quarter will be
dropped}. Lab assignments and grading are subject to change throughout
the quarter. Check D2L for specific lab submission deadlines and
requirements.

    \hypertarget{in-class-assignments}{%
\subsubsection{In-Class Assignments}\label{in-class-assignments}}

Most lecture days include an in-class assignment that needs to be
uploaded to D2L by the end of the class period. See D2L for specific
in-class assignment details. \textbf{No late in-class assignments will
be accepted}. \textbf{You must be present in lecture to receive credit
for the in-class assignment}. Your \textbf{lowest in-class assignment
score of the quarter will be dropped}. In-class assignments and grading
are subject to change throughout the quarter.

    \hypertarget{group-project}{%
\subsubsection{Group Project}\label{group-project}}

You will complete a group project throughout the quarter. Project
delivery will be at the end of the quarter during finals week. Students
must be present when their project is delivered to receive credit.
During the quarter, there will be occasional project assignments to
complete. See D2L for the project description and grading details.
\textbf{No late projects will be accepted}.

\subsubsection{Attendance, Make-Up, and Other Class
Policies}\label{attendance-make-up-and-other-class-policies}}

Attendance at all labs and lectures is required. Attendance may be used
in the grading process. Tardy students may be denied entry to class or
docked in credit for in-class assignments. Poor attendance or repeated
tardiness will have an adverse effect on a student's grade for the
course.

Students should check their @pcc.edu email at least three times a week
to ensure receipt of announcements and essential information about the
class.

Students may only attend this course if registered. Students who are
unable to attend must drop the course online or through the PCC
Registration Office. To remove tuition charges, the course must be
dropped by the student before the drop deadline posted on MyPCC.
Students who never attend, or stop attending, without dropping may
receive a W or a failing grade and will be required to pay for the
course.

The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or
substitute assignments and learning activities in response to
institutional, weather or class situations. To find out if the college
is closed due to bad weather, please check the
